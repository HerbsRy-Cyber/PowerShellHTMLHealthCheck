# PowerShell HTML Health Check
PowerShell Template for generating HTML reports.

Designed in mind for Service Desk Support Technicians who can generate a report from a faulty machine and attach the report to a ticket, not only for auditing purposes but to help additional team members understand the current state of a machine when escalating the ticket to other teams / support levels.

The template comes pre-populated with several WMI Queries and native cmdlets to help get you started, with that said, the template has been designed to be generic and not tied down to any specific type of machine with no specific assemblies required.

This project is open to ideas and contributions.
